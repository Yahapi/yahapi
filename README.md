# Yet Another Hypermedia(ish) API specification

If you're looking for a pragmatic Hypermedia-enabled REST convention for your project; Yahapi is the answer. Yahapi guides your API design to:

- … link resources to each other;
- … embed different resource types within your JSON response;
- … provide a single unified error format for you API;
- … promote you to add references to your API documentation in your JSON response;
- … define how to return partial results;
- … sort and paginate collections.
