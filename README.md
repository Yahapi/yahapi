# Yet Another Hypermedia(ish) API specification

Yahapi is a basic hypermedia-enabled REST convention. Its primary goal is to simplify API decisions you might need to make while building backend API's.

Yahapi guides your API design to:

- … link resources to each other;
- … embed different resource types within your JSON response;
- … provide a single unified error format for you API;
- … promote you to add references to your API documentation in your JSON response;
- … define how to return partial results;
- … sort and paginate collections.

In the end Yahapi is just a list of preferences that make your API look nice, simple and consistent.
